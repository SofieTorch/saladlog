We’re nearing the end of the year, and as such we’re also coming towards the end of this project, 
which takes its penultimate bow with cauliflower, the mild brassica that also comes in vibrant hues of purple,
green and orange — not forgetting romanesco with its brilliant fractal florets.  
  
Whatever variety you’re using, you’ll find cauliflower is a versatile number, which loves salty, 
fresh and spicy things as much as it embraces creamy, cheesy flavours. 
But it’s also something that has enough substance to serve as a stand-in for other food types; 
admittedly I’ve never felt the need to style one into ‘rice’ or some sort of pseudo pizza base, 
but I appreciate carbohydrates aren’t always everyone’s friends, and for this purpose it does very well indeed.

That said, I often take advantage of using cauliflower as a replacement for meat, 
giving bulk and body to dishes where animals are often relied on to do so.
Roast one whole as a vegetarian centrepiece or as an alternative for Sunday lunch, 
bake in a cheesy sauce for ultimate childhood nostalgia, put some through your mac and cheese to up the vitamin ante — it’s a vegetable that can hold its own, 
meaning it deserves so much more than being relegated to the side of the plate.  
  
### Cauliflower Vada Pav  
Vada pav is the name of a street food dish from Mumbai, 
which is essentially a deep-fried ball of spiced mashed potato (that’s the vada part) 
served in a bread bun (that’s the pav), piled up with tangy chutney and fresh coriander. 
I first had one at Bundobust, a vegetarian small plates restaurant in Manchester, 
where it’s become something of a showstopper. In honesty, it’s not something I always order myself anymore, 
but this is more reflective of the strength of other dishes than anything else — although it remains an idea I absolutely love.  
  
You can check out a recipe for vada pav via Manali Singh ([Cook With Manali](https://www.cookwithmanali.com/vada-pav)), 
whose version is made up of four main parts: the vada, a dry garlic coconut chutney,
green chutney and a sweet tamarind chutney. Meera Sodha also has a great vegan recipe with a coriander and peanut chutney
[here](https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/dec/05/meera-sodha-christmas-recipe-for-vegan-vada-pav-with-coriander-and-peanut-chutney).  
  
I’ve made a variation that incorporates cauliflower to add a bit of texture and flavour, 
and also involves shallow frying and baking over deep-frying — which is something I find far too demanding in 
a domestic setting. Please know, however, that my version below is by no means traditional, 
and merely a take on a concept I think is a fantastic way of making vegetables filling, exciting and stretch a long way.

### *Serves 4*
* 400g cauliflower florets  
* 1 large potato (approx 350g), peeled and chopped  
* ½ an onion, chopped  
* 1tsp ginger  
* 1tsp garlic  
* 1tsp coriander  
* 1tsp cumin  
* ½tsp chilli flakes  
* 1tsp fennel seeds  
* 1tsp fenugreek leaves  
* 1 egg  
  
Plain or gram flour to dust (or follow Sodha’s recipe by making a batter with gram flour, 150g gram flour, ⅓ tsp baking powder and 165ml water)  
  
### For the Date and Tamarind Chutney
  
* 50g dates
* 100ml boiling water
* 1tsp tamarind paste
  
**To serve:**
* 4 x burger buns or bread rolls (or 8 x smaller rolls)
* 4 tbsp wholegrain mustard
* Cucumber, thinly sliced
* Coriander, chopped
  
Boil the potato until cooked, before draining and moving to a large bowl to mash up. Leave to cool.  
  
Next, fry the onion until soft and add the cauliflower florets, throwing in the ginger, chopped garlic, 
coriander, cumin, chilli flakes, fennel seeds and fenugreek leaves. Fry everything for around 15 minutes or until the cauliflower is well cooked 
— carefully adding splashes of water if it begins to stick. When cooked, leave to cool before stirring the cauliflower mix through the 
potato with 1 beaten egg, mashing everything up together.  
  
Shape into thick patties the shape of a slightly flattened small cricket ball. At this stage, 
you can then either dust in flour and leave to chill in fridge for half an hour, or, if you want to take the more traditional route, 
leave them to chill while you make a batter — mixing the flour and baking powder and adding the water gradually until it’s a thick but pourable consistency.  
  
If you’ve gone for the first approach, you can then shallow fry the patties in oil and bake in an 180°C oven for another 20 minutes. 
If you’re taking the traditional method, coat each patty in the batter and either deep fry or — as Sodha does, fry in 3cm of oil set 
over a low to medium heat. (She advises you to test by dripping in a bit of batter first).  
  
As they cook, make the chutney by soaking the dates in the boiling water for 10 minutes and blitzing up with the tamarind paste.  
  
To serve, spread wholegrain mustard on one side of each toasted bun, and top this with the potato and cauliflower patty, 
followed by fresh coriander and thinly-sliced cucumber. Spread the date and tamarind chutney onto the other half of the bun and place it on top.
